RolloverBeethoven
=================

Not to be horribly self-conscious, but really, WTF is up with that name?!?  Anyhoo...

Overview
--------
This is a straightforward set of helpers to make pretty rollover images and section titles, using ImageMagick and TTF fonts.  The fonts should go in #{RAILS_ROOT}/fonts.  If the specified font doesn't exist, ImageMagick will still generate text using it's default font.

RB will create it's images in /public/images/auto.  This directory is not created automatically, so you will need to manually create it and give it appropriate permissions.

Once included in your /vendor/plugins tree, RB should be ready to roll.  The two primary helpers are 'graph_text' and 'rollover'.  Each of these takes an option hash, as described in the plugins' /lib/rollover_beethoven.rb file.  At it's most basic:

  rollover :text => 'The Rapture Index', :link => 'http://www.raptureready.com/rap2.html'
    -- or --
  graph_text :text => 'I AM A SPARTAN IN THE BATTLE OF THEMOPYLAE!!!' # Charlie's post-feeding mantra

There are many, many more potential options to pass in.  There are also variants of 'graph_text' and 'rollover' which return the entire working hash of the call.  These methods are 'graph_text_hash' and 'rollover_hash'.  This is useful if you feed in the :width => :auto option, and need to know how wide it wound up being.  The hash methods return the normal tag as the :tag key.

...include In Your Layout
-------------------------
So.... the 'rollover' and 'graph_text' methods will return a div/link construction... you will need to include the generated CSS in the HEAD of the page for all of this to work.  In your layout .rhtml, simply include 'yield :rollover_css' in the HEAD section.  The generated CSS is not particularly pretty (ok, it's god-awful ugly), but it works.

The plugin caches all images in the 'auto' folder, and it crafts the image filename based on a hash of parameters.  During initial setup, however, you'll probably find yourself needing to manually wipe /public/images/auto occasionally -- this is harmless.  Nothing in this directory ever needs to be kept.

To Do
-----
+ Put in SVN!
+ Add rake task to wipe cache
+ init.tb should create /public/images/auto if it's nonexistant (i.e. first run)
+ rename /public/images/auto to /public/images/rb_cache (or something else more meaningful)
+ fix bugs? :)
